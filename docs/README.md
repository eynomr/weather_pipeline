# Weather Data Pipeline

## Overview
The weather data pipeline is designed to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, transform the data using dbt, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is orchestrated using Dagster, which manages the execution, scheduling, and monitoring of the data pipeline.
